# ssh1 - script to connect to an existing Scylla cluster + loaders previous
# created with SCT using the script nyh/run2a3, and run a benchmark.
#
# What exactly ssh1 runs can be chosen with environment variables:
#
# * (unconditional right now) Run write throughput benchmark
# * isolation:  set to "forbid_rmw" for writes without LWT (the default),
#               or to "always_use_lwt" (with LWT).
# * aws:        if empty (default), benchmark the Scylla servers.
#               If "aws is set, we test the real DynamoDB in that Amazon
#               region (e.g., "aws=us-east-1").
# * wcu:        The WCU (write capacity units) to create the table in
#               provisioned billing mode. without it, use on-demand billing
#               mode. Ignored in !aws mode.
#               wcu is also used to set the maximum rate sent by each loader
#               to wcu / number_of_loaders.
# * fieldcount, fieldlength: Control the size of each item, as fieldcount
#               attributes of size fieldlength each. The defaults are 10,256.
# * time:       how much time (in seconds) to run the test. Defaults to 300.
# * usertable:  how to call the table used for the YCSB test. This defaults
#               to usertable_$(logname), but if you want to run multiple
#               tests in parallel, you may need to change this.
